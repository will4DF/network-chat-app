# Networking Chat App

This project is a simple two-part chat application using a 
client-server networking model. One program (the server) listens for 
incoming connections and handles messages from the client; the other 
(the client) connects to the server and sends messages. This demonstrates 
basic Python socket communication while 
fulfilling the networking module requirements for CSE 310.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. FEnsure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project folder in Terminal or your IDE.
  

Instructions for using the software:

1. To start the server:
2. Run the server program:
   python3 server.py
   The server will start listening on localhost:5000 (or your specified host/port).
3. To connect as a client:
   Run the client program in a new terminal:
   python3 client.py
   Once connected, you can type messages to send to the server.
